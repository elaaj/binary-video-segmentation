Some tips: 

To change the chosen video, it is necessary to manually change the variable: 
  - **videoToLoad**, as indicated in the comment.

To choose between the two methods, it is necessary to manually edit: 
  - **chosenAlgorithm**, following the instructions given in the comment. 


At the end of the execution the program will automatically create the segmented video in the same folder as the input video. 
Changing between the **two methods** means that if we have already run the program it will overwrite the video created by the previous method.
